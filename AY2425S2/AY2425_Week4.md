## After Action Review

Good for what it was
The session seemed to bring the older members/hardcore crowd back so making quiz with â€˜easierâ€™ in mind ended up being slightly for naught
Needed to communicate better who was hosting, espECIALLY since we de-emphasised the (competitive) quiz aspect to a considerable extent and focused more on cooperation-ish, chill parts of the session
in conclusion, live and learn, directly establish and confirm whoâ€™s hosting next time
