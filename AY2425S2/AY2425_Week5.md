## After Action Review

Today’s session was a success, despite the low turnout.
the presentation went relatively smoothly, the minigames were fun, well-received and cultivated a spirit of cooperation, and showing off pokemon showdown and having a few battles on the visualiser was hype and did its job of showing off how accessible (competitive) pokemon battling can be, especially compared to trying to train/raise/battle on the Switch.
