## After Action Review

What went well?
Being able to interact with the presenters and prompting them to improvise more by asking questions was pretty good!

What did not go as planned?
What happens if groups really cannot present?

What future improvements can be done?
Maybe have a template ready, or ensure that someone is willing to present in each team.
