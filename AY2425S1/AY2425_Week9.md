## After Action Review

What went well?: Yea, like keef said, most of the attendies were familiar with vtubers alr, so the info was more of a refressher for them. There were a few who were not familiar, but from what I can tell they at least got listen and never like use their phones during the presentation so I take it as a win. They also enjoyed the clip section, I think that was more of the highlight cause they are watching something they already enjoyed and was a good way to showcase what vtubers are in a lighthearted way.  

What did not go as planned?: Some of the clips, while funny, went on for quite a while, and I could see some people start to lose interest when the clip say exceeded 3 mins. 

What future improvements can be done?: If we do a clip sharing, not just for vtubers but like videos in general, for snippits of content, maybe try to keep it below 3 mins unless it's established from the start it's gonna be a long video. Cause I think their expectations for clips is short and sweet, so too long might make them become a bit impatient
